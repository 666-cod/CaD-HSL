# CaD-HSL
Forecasting technology trends from large collections of project documents is essential for strategic planning.However, existing approaches often treat technological factors as isolated time series or rely on static pairwise networks, failing to capture the evolving high-order correlations and dynamic causal mechanisms behind technology trend shifts. To address these limitations, we present CaD-HSL, an interactive information processing system for interpretable technology trend forecasting. CaD-HSL transforms unstructured project descriptions into a sequence of dynamic hypergraphs, where each project induces a high-order technology co-occurrence relation and learns a sparse directed causal graph that captures predictive dependencies among technologies over time.To make forecasts explainable, CaD-HSL integrates a GraphRAG module that retrieves upstream causal drivers from the learned graph and grounds LLM explanations on structured evidence, including driver sets, edge strengths, and forecast signals.The web-based interface enables users to explore global causal structures, inspect local ego-networks, compare univariate and causal-driven forecasts, and automatically generate attribution reports for trend shifts. Empirical evaluation shows that CaD-HSL reduces MSE by 19% compared to univariate baselines while providing transparent, evidence-grounded insights for decision-makers.
